        "QUESTION": "What will you do if this contract breaks?",
        "ANSWER": "If such a circumstance arises, we will migrate to a new contract and send all users the new token at a 1:1 ratio."

      {
        "QUESTION": "How do I know which groups are safe to join?",
        "ANSWER": "Managers will develop reputation over time, and the Trade List should be carefully checked before joining any Trade Group. Groups with more iFUND staked by the Fund Manager compared to the value of ETH collected offer a better risk-to-reward ration for users."

        "QUESTION": "Who are you and why are you remaining anonymous?",
        "ANSWER": "We are releasing our fully functional system and want the focus to be on hte product and not its creators."

      {
        "QUESTION": "Why are you doing a sale instead of letting us yield farm for distribution?",
        "ANSWER": "Yield farming systems disproportionately reward whales, so we consider a sale significantly fairer."

        "QUESTION": "Why don’t you have a burn mechanic?",
        "ANSWER": "Burns inflate the cost of transactions, and we don’t believe they have much effect outside marketing."
