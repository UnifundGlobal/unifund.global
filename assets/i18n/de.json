Group entry fees are locked with the Fund Manager’s collateral until the end of the round, while other users can stake for rewards risk-free. <br/><br/> The team’s dedicated share of tokens will be slowly unlocked over time, to protect against the toxic stereotype of crypto teams dumping their tokens all at once, causing a potentially negative market event."
